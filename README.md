SIMULATION STUDIES FOR COMBINATIONS OF SMALL MOLECULE FLUOROPHORES

Madeline E. McCarthy and Marc R. Birtwistle

1.) Inputs for probe simulations are found in SingleProbeVariables_IDT.mat. 

2.) These inputs can be loaded into the scripts GenerateIDT_5probes_3l_HN.m and GenerateIDT_5probes_5l_HN.m 

3.) The outputs for these scripts contain the lists of good probes along with the lists of probes removed in each round.
